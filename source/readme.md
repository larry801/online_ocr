# Online image describer addon #

* Author: Larry Wang
* NVDA compatibility: from 2018.3 to 2021.1
* Download [development version][2]

This addon aims at adding online image recognition engines to NVDA.
There are two types of engines. OCR and image describer.
OCR extract text from image.
Image describer describe visual features in image in text form.
Such as general description, color type landmarks and so on.
Internet connection is required to use this addon, since image describe services are provided by API endpoints on the Internet.
They are called engines in this addon.
There are three types of engine for this addon.

* Online OCR engine
* Online image describer engine
* Windows 10 OCR engine (offline)

You also need to choose the source of recognition image.

* Current navigator object
* Current foreground window
* The whole screen
* Image data or file from clipboard
* Image file pathname or image url from clipboard

### Keyboard commands

After choosing these types, you can start recognition with one gesture. 
NVDA+Alt+P  Perform recognize according to source and engine type setting, Then read result. If pressed twice, open a virtual result document.

There are four additional gestures left unassigned. Please assign them before using.
Cycle through different recognition engine types.
cycle through different recognition source types.
Cancel current recognition
This gesture can be useful if you think you have waited for too long and want to cancel.
Also sometimes you do not want to be disturbed by recognition message because you need to review some messages arrived after recognition start.

Show previous result in a virtual result document.
Though there is a feature to copy result to clipboard. Character position information cannot be preserved, so this gesture is added to solve this problem.


There are also four old gestures are left unassigned for users who prefer gestures in previous versions. 
It is recommended to use new gesture and switch engine type according to your need.

Recognize current navigator object with online OCR engine Then read result. If pressed twice, open a virtual result document.

Recognizes image in clipboard with online OCR engine. Then read result. If pressed twice, open a virtual result document.

Recognize current navigator object Then read result. If pressed twice, open a virtual result document.

Recognizes image in clipboard . Then read result. If pressed twice, open a virtual result document.


## Engine Configuration

You can choose recognition engines and configure them in detail in *Online Image Describer* category in NVDA settings dialog.

The author of addon have registered account with free API quota and set up a proxy server on www.nvdacn.com to make this addon easier to test at first. Test quota is limited and may be cancelled by API provider anytime.
It is highly recommended to register your own key according to guide in each engine.

The following settings are applicable to all engines.

* Copy recognition result to the clipboard:
If enabled, recognition result text will be copied to clipboard after recognition.

* Use browseable message for text result
If enabled, recognition result text will be shown in a popup window instead of speech or braille message. 

* Swap the effect of repeated gesture with none repeated ones:
By default, a virtual result document is shown only if you press the corresponding gesture twice, if you use that frequently you can enable this option so that you only need to press once to get a result viewer.

* Enable more verbose logging for debug purposes:
Some logs are essential for debugging but affects performance and takes up a lot of space. Only turn this on if specifically instructed to by the addon author or an NVDA developer.

* Proxy type:
Which type of proxy you are using. If you do not know what a proxy is just leave it as is.

* Proxy address:
Full URL of your proxy. If you do not know what a proxy is just leave it as is.
If you choose to use proxy your proxy will be verified before saving , after verification, there will be a prompt to tell you result.
The following settings means the same in all engines, describe them here to save space.

* API Access Type:
This controls how you get access to the corresponding API endpoints.
If you choose "Use public quota", you are using free quota in an account registered by addon author.
If you choose "Use your own API key", this addon will use quota from your own account.

* APP ID, API key or API Secret Key:
If you want to use quota from your own account corresponding access tokens is required. Some engines only need API key.
Some engines require two tokens.
These are only valid if you choose "use your own API key" in API Access type.
 

Note that the quality and accuracy of results are affected by many factors.

* Models and techniques used by engine provider
* Quality of uploaded image
* Is navigator object hidden behind something else
* Screen resolution
 

## Online image description

Here are three engines available.

### Microsoft Azure Image Analyser

This engine extracts a rich set of visual features based on the image content. 
This engine is english only. If you want description in other languages, you can use Microsoft Azure Image Describer

Visual Features include:
Adult - detects if the image is pornographic in nature (depicts nudity or a sex act). Sexually suggestive content is also detected.
Brands - detects various brands within an image, including the approximate location. The Brands argument is only available in English.
Categories - categorizes image content according to a taxonomy defined in documentation.
Color - determines the accent color, dominant color, and whether an image is black&white.
Description - describes the image content with a complete sentence in supported languages.
Faces - detects if faces are present. If present, generate coordinates, gender and age.
ImageType - detects if image is clip art or a line drawing.
Objects - detects various objects within an image, including the approximate location. The Objects argument is only available in English.
Tags - tags the image with a detailed list of words related to the image content.

Some features also provide additional details:

Celebrities - identifies celebrities if detected in the image.
Landmarks - identifies landmarks if detected in the image.

### Microsoft Azure Image describer

This engine generates a description of an image in human readable language with complete sentences. The description is based on a collection of content tags, which are also returned by the operation. More than one description can be generated for each image. Descriptions are ordered by their confidence score.
There are two settings for this engine.

* Language
The language in which the service will return a description of the image. English by default.

* Maximum Candidates
Maximum number of candidate descriptions to be returned. The default is 1.

This engine can also get position of every character

Here are its settings:

Get position of every character allows you to do more precise operation on some inaccessible application. Enabling this will make recognition slightly slower.

Use Accurate API 
If is enabled will use a different endpoint.
That accurate endpoint takes longer time but has higher quality and (If you use your own API key its price is also higher).

It has four endpoints with separate quota limit.

Basic OCR without any information about text location.
Currently 50000 times a day.
Basic OCR with information about text location.
Currently 500 times a day.
Accurate OCR without any information about text location.
Currently 500 times a day.
Accurate with information about text location.
Currently 50 times a day.

If you press the gesture which only read result, you are using endpoints without any information about text location. 
If you press the gesture which shows an result viewer, you are using endpoints with information about text location. 

Though it provides a quite generous free quota, its website is Chinese only and not quite accessible.

### Tencent AI OCR

This API is free to use with frequency limit about two query per second.  
If you want to bypass the limit you can register your own API key. The website of this API is Chinese only and not quite accessible.
There is no information about language support in the document. According to my test Chinese and English and their mixture is supported.  
There is no additional configuration for this API.
